# Enabling SSL authentication in NGINX

Follows the steps we have to execute to enable SSL authentication in a site
proxied by NGINX. For the authentication system we will consider OpenSSL.
This *howto* is composed by two parts, first the server setup necessary to be done
once, to enable it to answer `https` requests; and then the steps (and) scripts
necessary each time a new user subscribes to the system and when a user is later removed.

## Part1: enabling SSL on NGINX

Independent of which or amount of users we should support in our system,
OpenSSL and NGINX must be setup to, respectively, authenticate the kind of
certificate our users are going to present and to offer users an interface
for (safe) authentication.

### OpenSSL

To configure OpenSSL we may modify (or create) the default *CA* section in
`openssl.cnfg` as follows. (In this config we are going to consider the
directory `/etc/ssl/ca` as the one holding the necessary files for our
authentication setup.)

```
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default                 # The name of the CA configuration to be used.
                                        # can be anything that makes sense to you.
[ CA_default ]
dir = /etc/ssl/ca                       # Directory where everything is kept

certs = $dir/certs                      # Directory where the issued certs are kept
crl_dir = $dir/crl                      # Directory where the issued crl are kept
database = $dir/index.txt               # database index file.
#unique_subject = no                    # Set to 'no' to allow creation of
                                        # several certificates with same subject.
new_certs_dir = $dir/certs              # Default directory for new certs.

certificate = $dir/ca.crt               # The CA certificate
serial = $dir/serial                    # The current serial number
crlnumber = $dir/crlnumber              # The current crl number
                                        # must be commented out to leave a V1 CRL
crl = $dir/crl.pem                      # The current CRL
private_key = $dir/private/ca.key       # The private key
RANDFILE    = $dir/private/.rand        # private random number file

x509_extensions = usr_cert              # The extentions to add to the cert

name_opt = ca_default                   # Subject Name options
cert_opt = ca_default                   # Certificate field options

default_days    = 365                   # how long to certify for
default_crl_days= 30                    # how long before next CRL
default_md    = sha1                    # use public key default MD
preserve    = no                        # keep passed DN ordering

policy = policy_match
```

The directories in our `openssl.cnfg` must be created now. Considering -- again --
we are going to use `/etc/ssl/ca` for the our site's authentication files structure,
we have then:
```
$ SSL_DIR="/etc/ssl/ca"
$
$ mkdir -p "$SSL_DIR/private"
$ mkdir -p "$SSL_DIR/certs"
$ mkdir -p "$SSL_DIR/crl"
```

And initialise reference lists:
```
$ touch $SSL_DIR/index.txt
$ echo '01' > $SSL_DIR/crlnumber
```

Finally -- regarding OpenSSL setup -- we create the certificate files for
users authentication (for 1 year),
```
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out "$SSL_DIR/private/ca.key" 4096
$
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key "$SSL_DIR/private/ca.key" \
          -out "$SSL_DIR/certs/ca.crt"
```

and revocation list:
```
$ openssl ca -name CA_default -gencrl \
             -keyfile "$SSL_DIR/private/ca.key" \
             -cert "$SSL_DIR/certs/ca.crt" \
             -out "$SSL_DIR/private/ca.crl" -crldays 365
```

And, for our indoor purposes, a self-authenticated server:
```
# Create the Server Key, CSR, and Certificate
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out $SSL_DIR/private/server.key 1024
$ openssl req -new -key $SSL_DIR/private/server.key -out $SSL_DIR/private/server.csr

# Remove the necessity of entering a passphrase for starting up nginx with SSL using the private key
$ cp $SSL_DIR/private/server.key $SSL_DIR/private/server.key.org
$ openssl rsa -in $SSL_DIR/private/server.key.org -out $SSL_DIR/private/server.key

# We're self signing our own server cert here (not for production)
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in $SSL_DIR/private/server.csr \
          -CA $SSL_DIR/certs/ca.crt \
          -CAkey $SSL_DIR/private/ca.key -set_serial 02 \
          -out $SSL_DIR/certs/server.crt
```

### Nginx

To make Nginx aware of the SSL certification process we must include a section
(*i.e, virtual host*) for the `443` interface pointing to those files we have
just handled.

We should include a section like the following in `nginx.conf` (`http {...}`):
```
server {
  listen 443;

  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/ca/certs/server.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/ca/private/server.key;

  ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/ca/certs/ca.crt;
  ssl_crl /etc/ssl/ca/private/ca.crl;
  ssl_verify_client on;

  ssl_session_timeout 5m;

  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  ssl_ciphersALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv3:+EXP;

  location / {
          try_files $uri;
  }
}
```


This was about **Part 1**, the server authentication infrastructure.
Now, Part 2, is simply about inserting or removing users (clients).


## Part 2: Creating and removing users

### Create user certificate

The procedure below (in `new_client.sh`) will generate a `.p12` file for the
user to access the service provided by Nginx.
The steps below are all included in script `new_client.sh` which may simply be
executed like:
```
$ ./new_client.sh $NEW_USERNAME
```

A file named `$NEW_USERNAME.p12` was created that should be send to the user,
this is the file the user will use to authenticate in the system.

### Revocate user certificate

To remove a user from the authentication system we execute the script `rm_client.sh`:
```
$ ./rm_client.sh $OLD_USERNAME
```


## Test

At this point the user will include the `.p12` file in his/her browser SSL/certificates
list. In the browser's settings/authentication/certificates section the file
may be included by using the passphrase used when generating the certificate
(in `new_client.sh`).
